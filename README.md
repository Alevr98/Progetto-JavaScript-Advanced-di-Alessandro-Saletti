### DESCRIPTION
In this project I created a WebSite that catches data from an external API and shows the data required about main cities in the world. I believe that this can help you figure out which is the best city for your habits, allowing also to compare the towns one another.

### WEBSITE FEATURES

The Charts explain you better the strengths of each town and data are always updated.
